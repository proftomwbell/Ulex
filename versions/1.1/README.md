## Open Source Legal Operating System

## Version 1.1 (2017)

### Introduction to Version 1.0

This document makes Ulex, an open source legal operating system, available for
public use. Like all software, the formal algorithms of Ulex generate desired results in a
regular, predictable, programmable manner. Like the operating system that makes a
computer or smartphone user-friendly, Ulex provides a legal platform for running everything
from a business pursuing profit, to an individual seeking work, to a family seeking
happiness. To all these and more, Ulex offers a fair and efficient legal system. And like any
open source program, Ulex is not doled out by the dime but instead free for anyone to
download, use, and modify. They need only adopt and implement by mutual express consent
the procedural, substantive, and meta-rules that follow this brief introduction.<sup>[1](#fn1)</sup>
Ulex does not so much create the law as curate it, combining specialized rule sets
from trusted sources into a simple but comprehensive legal system. It covers _civil law_ in the
sense of _private law_ — not in the sense of _Roman_ law and not in contrast to _common law_.<sup>[2](#fn2)</sup> As
such, Ulex by default does not include criminal law, which concerns not purely private
matters, but instead offenses against the public at large. Ulex 1.0 instead offers criminal law
as an optional module.
With regard to all areas of law, Ulex offers both _procedural_ rules, which define how
parties resolve their disputes, and _substantive_ rules, which describe their legal rights and
remedies. A few _meta-rules_ protect the system against the functional equivalent of what
computer programmers rue as "run-time" errors. Ulex merely sets default rules in most
cases, leaving users free to run other legal systems "on top of" it.<sup>[3](#fn3)</sup>

The default rules of Ulex 1.0 come from the _Restatements of the Common Law_ , the
_Uniform Commercial Code_ , and other select sources. To specify the rules is not to replicate
them, however. Some of the rule sets used in Ulex remain subject to copyright claims. Most
such copyright claimants nonetheless make their materials publicly available. Uniquely,
however, the American Law Institute (ALI) both claims copyrights in the black-letter rules of
the _Restatements_ and declines to make them publicly available.^4 Given that the Restatements
constitute binding public law in the United States, and that copyright cannot restrict public
access to public laws, the ALI's claim looks suspect. But resolution of that question must
wait. It would at all events prove taxing to duplicate every rule of Ulex 1.0 in this document,
which instead incorporates most of its constituent rules by reference, leaving users to access
specific provisions as the occasion requires and as they see fit.


#### Introduction to Version 1.1

Field tests of Ulex 1.0, while largely positive, suggested that few edits might improve
the performance of the system. Version 1.1 of Ulex thus duplicates version 1.0 but for these
four changes:

* Procedural rules trimmed and rearranged;
* A firewall against judicial excess added;
* Meta-rules amended and rearranged to add run-time stability; and
* Optional module offered for enactment by host sovereigns.

Explanations follow in order, below.

**Procedural rules trimmed and rearranged**. Version 1.1 does away with the
detailed procedural rules that version 1.0 had offered in Rule 1.3, which incorporated by
reference the American Arbitration Association's _Commercial Arbitration Rules and
Mediation Procedures_ (2010).^ Unsurprisingly, in retrospect, those rules defaulted to the
Association's preferred judges and procedures a bit too forcefully for some users.
Furthermore, to use the Association's rules would raise especially troubling copyright
complications. Ulex 1.1 thus relies on ALI & International Institute for the Unification of
Law's _Principles of Transnational Civil Procedure_ (2004). Those rules provide enough
detail to get the dispute resolution process started, and often to finish it, leaving parties to
choose other and more detailed rules if and when they see fit.
Another change in the procedural section: the order of the rules. Whereas version
1.0 put Ulex's basic triad of default rules before the _Principles of Transnational Civil_

(^4) Access to the _Restatements_ can be purchased in a variety of ways and formats: from ALI, for bound

[http://www.lexis.com/,](http://www.lexis.com/,) or HeinOnline, home.heinonline.org/. (All sites visited April 30, 2016).


_Procedure_ , version 1.1 reverses that order. Why? Because Ulex users want to trust that
those defaults will apply unless and until they expressly change them, and because the meta-
rule against conflicts (Rule 3.1 in version 1.0; Rule 3.3 in version 1.1) provides that later
rules prevail over earlier ones. Reversing the order of the rules in the procedural section thus
ensured that the default triad will prevail over anything in the _Principles of Transnational
Civil Procedure_ to the contrary. Users who want other procedures can, of course, adopt them
by separate agreement.

**A firewall against judicial excess added.** Ulex 1.1's new Rule 2.9 would apply in
those rare instances when the judges chosen under Ulex's procedural rules face a question not
resolvable by Ulex's extensive collection of other substantive rules. Rule 2.9 would then
contain the crisis, saving the larger system from failure. Even if never put to use, this legal
firewall would quietly give users greater confidence in Ulex.
Rule 2.9 is not the only or even necessarily the best way to deal with questions arising
outside the substantive rules of Ulex. Claims not founded in the rules should face sufficient
discouragement in the prospect of a motion to dismiss and the fact that a losing party must
pay the prevailing party's costs. It is not inconceivable, however, that parties to an otherwise
rule-based dispute might invite the court to decide a relatively minor issue, one related to
their dispute but not decided by any other rule.
For example, co-owners disputing their rights to a jointly owned house might invite
the court to decide what color they should paint it. Rule 2.9 would in the event require that
the court to decide the question in accord with common practice, the general tenor of the
rules, and a decent respect for human dignity. Tan or blue would probably suit nicely for the
house in question; puke green presumably would not.

**Meta-rules amended and rearranged to add run-time stability.** For reasons more
theoretical than practical, version 1.1 introduces two subtle changes to Ulex's meta-rules.
Both aim to protect the system from internal contradictions. In computer code, those kinds
of errors can cause a system to freeze up or shut down. In legal code, they would doubtless
have similarly unwelcome effects.
Version 1.0 already had a rule against such conflicts — Rule 3.1. Because it was not at
the very end of the rules listed in the index, though, there remained the possibility that some
later rule might contradict it. Version 1.1 fixes that bug by moving the rule against conflicts
to the very end of the meta-rules, to Rule 3.3.
Ulex 1.1 also changes the wording of this safeguard against conflicts, adding at the
end, "but no rule can prevail over this one." That additional clause bars the later addition of a
rule that contradicts the rule against contradiction. Perhaps that is over cautious. Those who
issue new versions of Ulex could instead simply always list the meta-rules last. If a
jurisdiction adopted the optional criminal law or integration modules, for instance, it could
rearrange and renumber the rules to ensure that the rule against contradiction comes at the
very end of the index. It is impossible to ensure that future Ulex editors will take that
precaution, though, so the newly added clause writes the anti-contradiction rule into the code
itself, protecting Ulex against run-time errors.


**Optional module offered for enactment by host sovereign.** This new and brief
collection of rules, offered in a new section 5, regulates the process through which a host
sovereign's courts review and reject or adopt the judgments of Ulex courts. In form and
effect, the Integration Module reflects the core provisions of the long-lived and widely
respected United States Federal Arbitration Act (FAA).^5 Subject to scrutiny for inherently
unfair adjudications, the FFA gives private arbitrations force of law, allowing the prevailing
private party to invoke public powers to enforce the private judgment. Module 5 does
likewise for decisions rendered under Ulex and presented for enforcement in the courts of a
host jurisdiction. In this way, special jurisdictions running Ulex can integrate more fully
with other legal systems.


Notes for Users

How can you run Ulex? Either move to a jurisdiction that has adopted the legal
system or, in what amounts to much the same thing, mutually agree with others to have Ulex
govern your legal relations. The first option remains for now only a theoretical possibility;
the second calls for little more than a handshake. To make it formal, an agreement to run
Ulex should have a choice of law and forum clause along these lines: "Ulex 1.1 governs any
claim or question arising under or related to this agreement, including the proper forum for
resolving disputes, all rules applied therein, and the form and effect of any judgment."
For greatest accuracy, citations to Ulex should note the version; e.g.: "Ulex 1.1" or
"Ulex 1.1 (2017)." Particular rules can be cited using this format: "Ulex 1.1, Rule 3.
(2017)." To cite this document, use the shortened URL: https://goo.gl/YByFti.

(^53) Here, Ulex adopts the race-notice form of recording statute most common in the United States.
_See_ , Ray E. Sweat, _Race, Race-Notice and Notice Statutes: The American Recording System,_ 3
PROBATE & PROPERTY 27 (May/June 1989) (cataloging popularity of various recording statutes and
providing model race-notice statute). This rule would apply only if the adopting jurisdiction had
created a land records office as envisioned by the ULC, Uniform Real Property Electronic Recording
Act (2005).
(^54) Many of the rule sets used in Ulex invoke age-related classifications, making a uniform definition
of adulthood useful. Elsewhere, age-related classifications vary across and even within legal systems.
Ulex sets the default at a relatively common age — 18 years old — leaving precocious children to bring
suit for emancipation, as in ULC, _Uniform Guardianship and Protective Proceedings Act_ § 210
(1997), or leaving adopting communities free to set a different default age for adulthood.


**3. Meta-Rules**


3.1. Alternative Rules: If a rule offers alternative provisions, the alternative offered
first prevails over any later one.


3.2. Alternative Meanings: If a rule refers to an institution, office, power, or
privilege that does not exist in a jurisdiction running Ulex, the rule instead
refers to the closest functionally equivalent institution, office, power, or
privilege that does or could exist in one.


3.3. Conflicting Rules: If different rules give conflicting results, the rule listed later
in this index prevails, but no rule can prevail over this one.

**5. Optional Integration Module** (for adoption by host sovereign)


5 .1. Sole Grounds for Revoking Agreement to Resolve Dispute Under Ulex. A
written agreement to resolve a dispute under Ulex shall be valid, irrevocable,
and enforceable except upon such grounds as exist at the time of its forming in
law or equity for revocation of a contract.^58


5.2. Sole Grounds for Modifying or Correcting Judgment Rendered Under Ulex.
A court may modify or correct a judgment rendered under Ulex only upon
application by a party subject to it and upon proof that: 1) The judgment
includes an evident and material numerical error or misidentification of a
person or thing named therein; 2) The judges decided a question outside of
their authority in a manner that substantively altered their decision upon
matters properly addressed; or 3) The judgment bears an imperfection in form
not affecting its substance. The court may then only modify or correct the
judgment, and then only so far as necessary to effectuate the evident intent of
the judgment and promote justice between the parties.^59


5.3. Force and Effect of Court Confirmation. A party moving for a court order
confirming a judgment rendered under Ulex shall file proof that the parties
agreed to submit to that judgment, that it was rendered in accord with the
referenced rules, and that the judgement issued as described. Absent
application of Rules 5.1 and 5.2, above, the court receiving the motion shall
give it the same force and effect in all respects as any judgment issued by the
court, and the judgment shall be so treated by all persons, institutions, officers,
or agents presented with the same.^60

allowing parties to specify what law controls matters within the scope of their agreement, which Ulex
incorporates by reference at rule 2.4.1.
