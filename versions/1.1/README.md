## 5. Optional Integration Module (for adoption by host sovereign)

### 5.1. Sole Grounds for Revoking Agreement to Resolve Dispute Under Ulex. 

A written agreement to resolve a dispute under Ulex shall be valid, irrevocable,
and enforceable except upon such grounds as exist at the time of its forming in law or equity for revocation of a contract.<sup>[7](#fn7)</sup>

### 5.2. Sole Grounds for Modifying or Correcting Judgment Rendered Under Ulex.

A court may modify or correct a judgment rendered under Ulex only upon
application by a party subject to it and upon proof that: 1) The judgment
includes an evident and material numerical error or misidentification of a
person or thing named therein; 2) The judges decided a question outside of
their authority in a manner that substantively altered their decision upon
matters properly addressed; or 3) The judgment bears an imperfection in form
not affecting its substance. The court may then only modify or correct the
judgment, and then only so far as necessary to effectuate the evident intent of
the judgment and promote justice between the parties.<sup>[8](#fn8)</sup>

### 5.3. Force and Effect of Court Confirmation. 

A party moving for a court order
confirming a judgment rendered under Ulex shall file proof that the parties
agreed to submit to that judgment, that it was rendered in accord with the
referenced rules, and that the judgement issued as described. Absent
application of Rules 5.1 and 5.2, above, the court receiving the motion shall
give it the same force and effect in all respects as any judgment issued by the
court, and the judgment shall be so treated by all persons, institutions, officers,
or agents presented with the same.<sup>[9](#fn9)</sup>

<a name="fn4"><sup>4</sup></a> Though the ALI no longer offers bound versions of this _Restatement_ for sale, it remains available
via the online sources listed in footnote 3, above. It provides a few crucial rules, though much of its
coverage has been superseded by later-published _Restatements_ covering specific areas of property
law.

<a name="fn5"><sup>5</sup></a> Here, Ulex adopts the race-notice form of recording statute most common in the United States.
_See_ , Ray E. Sweat, _Race, Race-Notice and Notice Statutes: The American Recording System,_ 3
PROBATE & PROPERTY 27 (May/June 1989) (cataloging popularity of various recording statutes and
providing model race-notice statute). This rule would apply only if the adopting jurisdiction had
created a land records office as envisioned by the ULC, Uniform Real Property Electronic Recording
Act (2005).

<a name="fn6"><sup>6</sup></a> Many of the rule sets used in Ulex invoke age-related classifications, making a uniform definition
of adulthood useful. Elsewhere, age-related classifications vary across and even within legal systems.
Ulex sets the default at a relatively common age — 18 years old — leaving precocious children to bring
suit for emancipation, as in ULC, _Uniform Guardianship and Protective Proceedings Act_ § 210
(1997), or leaving adopting communities free to set a different default age for adulthood.
